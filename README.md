# Yet-Unnamed-Java-Lan-Guessing-Game


**Status:** On development [Slowly]

As the name maybe suggests, this is an LAN Guessing Game made with Java.

The complete idea is an game where you can create/load a folder of JSON files which will be turned into cards of stuff, like people, places, food, games, etc... create a Room, and from there, the players will gain tips from the current card of the loaded deck so they can try to guess which is the theme of the current card in order to gain points until the end of the match.

This project is inspired my college extension project, where I developed an educational game about black history and culture, inspired by an famous game on the schools of my country: "Perfil", which has a similar mechanic.

The idea is not only to practice more Java, but to also make the possibility of my game to be (partially, as it haves a lot of specific gameplay mechanics and aesthetic choices which cannot be recreated on this project format) played on computers in schools, create a project that can bring fun to people and to allow other students and teachers to create similar games. 

**Current Tech**: Java with Jackson.
